                    <h5 style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px;">STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prep the Pan</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Wrap the springform pan with one large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil, covering the underside of the pan and extending all the way to the top. Repeat with another sheet of foil for insurance. Spray the inside of the pan with nonstick cooking spray.</p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 2: Make the Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Stir until well combined.</p>
                    <P style="text-align: left;">Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set. Remove the pan from the oven and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F.</P>

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 3: Make the Cheesecake Batter</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Beat on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure the mixture is evenly combined.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Add the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt; beat on low speed until just combined.                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Mix in the sour cream.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Make sure the batter is uniform but do not over-mix.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Pour the batter on top of the crust.                    </p>

                   
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 4: Bake</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Set the unbaked cheesecake in a large roasting pan. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it comes about one inch up the side of the cake pan. The water bath (also called a bain marie) regulates the temperature and keeps the cheesecake baking at an even, low heat. The steam/humidity created by the water bath also protects the cheesecake from drying out and cracking.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Bake until the cake is just set, 1 hour and 30 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The cake should not look liquidy at all but will wobble just a bit when the pan is nudged; it will continue to cook as it cools.</p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Step 5: Cool</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Cool the cheesecake in the water bath until the water is just warm, about 45 minutes. Remove the springform pan from the water bath, discard the foil, and transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator to cool for at least 8 hours or overnight.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Remove the sides of the springform pan. You can serve the cheesecake right from the base of the springform pan. Or, if you’d like to transfer it to a serving platter, run a long, thin spatula between the crust and the pan bottom, and then use two large spatulas to transfer the cheesecake to a serving dish. Slice with a sharp knife, wiping the knife clean between slices. Serve with berry sauce, if you like.</p>

                    <P style="text-align: left;">I used this website as a reference, and I appreciate the inclusion of images after each of the steps. This feature makes it easy for people to follow along and verify whether they are proceeding correctly. However, I have a suggestion for improvement. I believe the page could benefit from a more user-friendly layout. Specifically, I would prefer if the recipe section were larger, while the other links and commercial ads were made smaller.</P>

                    <a href="https://butternutbakeryblog.com/new-york-style-cheesecake/">Butternut bakery blog</a>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">This is another blog post demonstrating the process of making a New York Cheesecake. I am quite impressed with the website's choice of color palettes and fonts, which enhance the overall visual experience. However, I have a suggestion to enhance user convenience. It would be beneficial if the section titled "Equipment to bake a New York cheesecake at home" were positioned at the beginning of the page. This arrangement would allow readers to quickly assess if they possess the essential equipment needed for making the cheesecake before deciding whether to proceed with the recipe.</p>

                    <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015672-tall-and-creamy-cheesecake">NY Times Cooking</a>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">I love how the user-friendly navigation provided by NY Times Cooking, which effectively categorizes their diverse range of recipes. One feature I particularly appreciate is the ease with which I can access different recipe categories. For example, when I move my mouse over the top of the page, I can quickly access recipes categorized "by method," "by diet," or "by meal."</p>

                        <a href="https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/new-york-style-cheesecake.html">SSense</a>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            I appreciate the well-balanced layout employed by SSense, dividing their webpage into three distinct sections with ideal proportions. This design element has prompted me to consider a similar approach for my recipe website. Specifically, I'm contemplating the idea of segregating the essential equipment and ingredients into separate columns rather than grouping everything together.</p>


                         <a href="https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/home">Acne Studios</a>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">
                            I'm thrilled by the striking and attention-grabbing GIF featured on Acne Studios' main page. This dynamic GIF not only captivates the customer's attention but also effectively showcases the intricate details and designs of their products. It's a remarkable way to engage visitors and communicate the essence of their brand.</p>    
                                <a href="https://www.ganni.com/us/ganni-icons/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6p-oBhAYEiwAgg2PgnAvbGNsMiILUZNaV0EeUOQeu6t8ORq0S4sGMFHOS1WAq05MCR8eBxoCI4UQAvD_BwE">GANNI</a>
                                <p style="text-align: left;">
                                    
I am impressed by the design choices made on Ganni's website. The scrolling column at the top of their page is a clever and engaging feature that caught my attention. Additionally, their use of icons, such as the heart shape icon to signify adding an item to the wishlist, adds a user-friendly touch that I find quite appealing.</p>
