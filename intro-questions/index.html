            <h1>Hazel Tao's Intro Questions</h1>

            <p>1. My name is Hazel Tao. I am a junior majoring in Design under the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts.</p>

            <p>2. I am a transfer student who was previously pursuing a major in Graphic Design. I decided to take this class because I want to explore the other aspect of design.</p>
            <p>3. This is my first time learning about HTML/CSS/JS. </p>
            <P>4. I aim to enhance my familiarity with using HTML for design websites.</P>
            <p>5. I believe that designing for screens offer greater freedom and opportunities to engage with a broader audience compared to designing for paper.</p>
            <P>6. <a href="https://instabio.cc/firecrackercity"> Inju Park </a>I believe that this website created by the artist Inju Park exemplifies effective design because the font selection, color choices, and image sizes all beautifully showcase the artist's unique art style. </P>
            <P>7. <a href="https://odd-hyphen.com/"> Odd Hyphen </a> In my opinion, this website from Odd Hyphen studio exemplifies effective communication because each projects are all well organized and easy to follow with. </P>
            <p>8. <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/"> Tate </a> I think the Tate's webiste works well because it is clean and audiences are able to easily find informations they needed.</p>
